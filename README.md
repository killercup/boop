# boop!

A turn-based game about kittens that boop each other.

## My Rules

- hex grid
- three kittens in a row = win

## Origin

I saw [this TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJHJk3oM/) about [this game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/355433/boop).
And suddenly I wanted to write a game again!

### Original Rules

- board is 6x6
- on your turn
  - you can place a kitten on an empty slot
    - all kittens on fields touching this one get booped away one field
    - kittens can be booped off the edge
    - if a kitten has another kitten against it to a side, it cannot be booped to that side
    - cats are not booped
  - or place a cat on an empty slot
    - all kittens and cats are booped
- three kittens (or 1-3 kittens and 1-2 cats) in the same color are removed from the board and turn into three cats
- three cats in a row win

### Random ideas

- 3d with cute cat and kitten models
- alternative rule: three kittens turn into one cat
- alternative rule: kittens don't fall off but reappear on the other side of the board
